<h1 align="center">Random Color Generator</h1>

## About
I have created this application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features
You can see one button i.e., "Get New Color" everytime on clicking it you can see the background color changes randomly with a #color code. Also you can copy the #color code 
by clicking the copy button and use it on your websites.
